Adds a 'confirm email address' field to the WooCommerce checkout page.

== Description ==

"WooCommerce Email Validation" is a small extension for WooCommerce that adds a 'confirm email address' field to the checkout page as a required field. This will ensure that your customers will enter a correct email address, making managing your orders far easier and more reliable. If a customer's email address does not match up then they will receive a standard validation error on the checkout page informing them that they need to make sure that their email addresses are the same.

This extension is WooCommerce 2.x compatible and supports localisation using WPML.
